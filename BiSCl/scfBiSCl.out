     Please, verify this is what you really want

     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     highest occupied level (ev):     4.6079

!    total energy              =   -4250.55561235 Ry
     total all-electron energy =   -179175.466422 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000074 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =    -318.41376873 Ry
     hartree contribution      =     223.52481842 Ry
