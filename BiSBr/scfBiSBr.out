     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

!    total energy              =   -4757.56433945 Ry
     total all-electron energy =   -196342.103676 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000079 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =    -323.89464587 Ry
     hartree contribution      =     225.58531213 Ry
